Create a class Contest with below attributes
int contestId
String contestName
String contestWinner
int points
String category
Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.
Create class Solution with main method

Implement two static methods-
findTotalPointsBasedOnWinner
getContestWithSecondHighestPoints

findTotalPointsBasedOnWinner in the solution class. This method will take array of Contest objects, String contestWinner and returns the total 
number of points which matches with contestWinner if found else return 0 if not found.

getContestWithSecondHighestPoints in the Solution class. This method will take array of Contest objects and String category and returns the 
Contest object having the second highest points for the given category, if found else return null if not found.

This method should be called from main method.
Write code to perform following tasks:
1. Take necessary input variable and call findTotalPointsBasedOnWinner. For this method- The main method should print the total number of points 
for given winner. As if the returned value is no 0, or it should print "There is no matching contest".

2. Take necessary input variable and call getContestWithSecondHighestPoints. For this method- The main method should print the Contest object 
points as it is if the returned value us not null, or it should print "There is no matching contest.‚Äù.
