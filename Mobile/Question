with String brand, if found else return 0 if not found.

getSecondHighestPrice in the Solution class. This method will take array of Mobile objects and returns the Mobile object having the second highest price if price is 
odd. if found else return null if not found.

This method should be called from main method.
Write code to perform following tasks:
1. Take necessary input variable and call countMobileByBrand. For this method- The main method should print the number for given brand. As if the returned value is not
0, or it should print "No Such Mobile Found ".

2. Take necessary input variable and call getSecondHighestPrice. For this method- The main method should print the all details of returned mobile object as is if the 
returned value is not null, or it should print "No such mobile found‚Äù.

Note- All the searches should be case insensitive. Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Phone objects referring
attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence. Next, read the value for brand.
