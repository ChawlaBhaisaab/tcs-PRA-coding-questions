Create a class Player with below attributes
int playerId
String playerlName
Int runs
String playerType
String matchType
Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.

Create class Solution with main method
Implement two static methods in Solution class-
findPlayerWithLowestRuns in the solution class. This method will take array of Player objects, String playerType and returns least runs of the player. If the 
playerType of any Player object matches with String playerType, if found else return 0 if not found.

findPlayerByMatchType in the Solution class. This method will take array of Player objects and String matchType  and returns the array of Player objects in 
descending order of their playerId. For player objects which have matchType  equal to String matchType  input. If found else return null if not found.

This method should be called from main method.
Write code to perform following tasks:
1. Take necessary input variable and call findPlayerWithLowestRuns. For this method- The main method should print the returned runs. As if the returned value is not 0,
or it should print "No such player."
2. Take necessary input variable and call findPlayerByMatchType. For this method- The main method should print the playerId from return objects array. As it is if
the returned value is not null, or it should print "No Player with given match Type.‚Äù

Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Player objects referring attributes in the above mentioned
Attribute sequence.
Next read the value for string playerType and String matchType
All searches should be case insensitive.
