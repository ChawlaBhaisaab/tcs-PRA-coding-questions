Create a class Phone with below attributes
int phoneId
String os
String brand
int price
Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.
Create class Solution with main method

Implement two static methods-
findPriceForGivenBrand
getPhoneBasedOnOs

findPriceForGivenBrand in the solution class. This method will take array of Phone objects, String brand and returns price If the phone brand matches with String 
brand, if found else return 0 if not found.

getPhoneBasedOnOs in the Solution class. This method will take array of Phone objects and String os and returns the phone object. If phone os matches with String os, 
if found else return null if not found.

This method should be called from main method.
Write code to perform following tasks:
1. Take necessary input variable and call findPriceForGivenBrand For this method- The main method should print the price for given brand. As if the returned value is 
not 0, or it should print "The given Brand is not available ".

2. Take necessary input variable and call getPhoneBasedOnOs. For this method- The main method should print the id of return phone object as it is if the returned value 
is not null, or it should print "No phones are available with specified os ‚Äù.

Note- All the searches should be case insensitive. Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Phone objects referring 
attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence. Next, read the value for brand and os.
