Create a class Car with below attributes
int carId
int topSpeed
double milesTravelled
String brand
Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.
Create class Solution with main method

Implement two static methods-

getSecondLowestMilesTravelledCar

countCarsByBrand
countCarsByBrand in the solution class. This method will take array of Cars objects, String brand and returns the total number of car with brand name if found else 
return 0 if not found.

miles travelled whose travelled miles is more than miles input, if found else return null if not found.

This method should be called from main method.
Write code to perform following tasks:

returned value is no 0, or it should print "No such car found ".
