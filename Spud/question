 Create a class Spud with below attributes
int marketId
String spudType
String producingState
int price(per kg)
Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.

Create class Solution with main method
Implement two static methods in Solution class-
findTypeByState 
sortByPrice

findTypeByState in the solution class. This method will take array of Spud objects, String state and returns spud type if found. If the state of any object matches 
with String state, if found else return null if not found.

sortByPrice in the Solution class. This method will take array of Spud objects and int pirce and returns the array of Spud object is ascending order of their price 
which are less than Spud price input. If found else return null if not found.

This method should be called from main method.
Write code to perform following tasks:
1. Take necessary input variable and call findTypeByState . For this method- The main method should print the spudType from return object. As if the returned value is 
not null, or it should print "State not found."

2. Take necessary input variable and call sortByPrice. For this method- The main method should print the spudType and price from return object. As it is if the 
returned value is not null, or it should print "No Spud found.‚Äù

Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four spuds objects referring attributes in the above mentioned
Attribute sequence.
Next read the value for string parameter and int parameter.
